# Mini-Search-Engine
This project implements a simplified search engine based on Section 23.6 of the textbook, designed to index and search HTML documents from a small website. The implementation uses inverted indexing as the core data structure and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for ranking search results.
