    <h1>Incident Response in Cybersecurity</h1>

    <h2>What is Incident Response?</h2>
    <p>Incident Response is a structured approach to handling and managing the aftermath of a security breach or
        cyberattack. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and
        costs.</p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Incident Response</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation</strong> – Establishing and training an incident response team, and defining processes
            and tools</li>
        <li><strong>Detection and Analysis</strong> – Identifying and investigating security incidents</li>
        <li><strong>Containment</strong> – Limiting the spread and impact of the incident</li>
        <li><strong>Eradication</strong> – Removing the threat from the environment</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery</strong> – Restoring systems and services to normal operations</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Incident Activity</strong> – Learning from the incident and improving security measures</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Importance of Incident Response</h2>
    <p>Incident Response is crucial for organizations to minimize damage from cyber attacks, protect sensitive data,
        maintain business continuity, and comply with regulatory requirements. A well-prepared incident response team
        can significantly reduce the impact of security breaches.</p>

    <h2>Common Security Incidents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Malware infections</li>
        <li>Phishing attacks</li>
        <li>Data breaches</li>
        <li>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks</li>
        <li>Insider threats</li>
        <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop and maintain an incident response plan</li>
        <li>Regularly train staff on security awareness</li>
        <li>Implement robust monitoring and detection systems</li>
        <li>Conduct regular security assessments and drills</li>
        <li>Establish clear communication channels</li>
        <li>Document all incidents and lessons learned</li>
    </ul>
