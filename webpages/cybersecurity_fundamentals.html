    <h1>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h1>

    <p><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
        cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from
        users, or interrupting normal business processes.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles - The CIA Triad</h2>
    <p>The CIA triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that guides policies for information security within an
        organization.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. This involves implementing
        access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <p>Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Measures include
        file permissions, checksums, and version control.</p>

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>Ensuring that authorized users have reliable and timely access to information and resources. This requires
        maintaining hardware, performing upgrades, and ensuring network redundancy.</p>

    <h2>Common Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware</strong> - Malicious software including viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing</strong> - Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as trustworthy
            entities</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</strong> - Intercepting communications between two parties</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> - Overwhelming systems to make them unavailable</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Injection</strong> - Inserting malicious SQL code to manipulate databases</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-Day Exploits</strong> - Attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Defense Strategies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Defense in Depth</strong> - Multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system</li>
        <li><strong>Least Privilege</strong> - Users only get minimum access necessary for their job functions</li>
        <li><strong>Security Awareness Training</strong> - Educating users about security best practices</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Updates and Patches</strong> - Keeping systems up-to-date with latest security fixes</li>
        <li><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong> - Maintaining regular backups for disaster recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong> - Continuous surveillance of systems for suspicious activity</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Authentication and Access Control</h2>
    <p>Authentication verifies the identity of users and systems. Common methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passwords and PINs</li>
        <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
        <li>Biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Security tokens</li>
        <li>Certificate-based authentication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>Protecting the usability and integrity of network and data. Key components include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firewalls - Filter incoming and outgoing network traffic</li>
        <li>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)</li>
        <li>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) - Secure remote access</li>
        <li>Network segmentation - Dividing networks into smaller zones</li>
        <li>Secure protocols - HTTPS, SSH, SFTP</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Frameworks and Standards</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong> - Provides guidelines for managing cybersecurity risk</li>
        <li><strong>ISO 27001</strong> - International standard for information security management</li>
        <li><strong>CIS Controls</strong> - Prioritized set of actions to protect against common attacks</li>
        <li><strong>GDPR</strong> - Data protection and privacy regulation in EU</li>
        <li><strong>HIPAA</strong> - Healthcare data protection standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Incident Response</h2>
    <p>Organizations need a structured approach to handle security breaches:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation - Establish incident response team and procedures</li>
        <li>Identification - Detect and determine scope of incident</li>
        <li>Containment - Limit damage and prevent further compromise</li>
        <li>Eradication - Remove threat from environment</li>
        <li>Recovery - Restore systems to normal operation</li>
        <li>Lessons Learned - Analyze incident and improve defenses</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account</li>
        <li>Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible</li>
        <li>Keep software and systems updated</li>
        <li>Be cautious with email attachments and links</li>
        <li>Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Regular security audits and assessments</li>
        <li>Develop and test incident response plans</li>
        <li>Implement principle of least privilege</li>
    </ul>
