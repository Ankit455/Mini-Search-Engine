    <h1>Cryptography</h1>

    <p><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Cryptography is the science of securing information through mathematical techniques that transform readable data
        into unintelligible ciphertext. Modern cryptography forms the backbone of digital security, protecting
        everything from online banking to secure communications.</p>

    <h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>
    <p>Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
        represents the most widely used symmetric algorithm, providing strong security for <a
            href="cloud_security.html">cloud</a> and local data protection. The main challenge with symmetric encryption
        is securely distributing the shared key between parties.</p>

    <h3>Common Symmetric Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - Industry standard for data encryption</li>
        <li>DES (Data Encryption Standard) - Older algorithm, now considered insecure</li>
        <li>3DES (Triple DES) - Enhanced version of DES, still used in legacy systems</li>
        <li>ChaCha20 - Modern stream cipher, efficient for mobile devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
    <p>Asymmetric encryption uses paired public and private keys. The public key encrypts data while the private key
        decrypts it. RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are prominent asymmetric algorithms. This approach solves
        the key distribution problem inherent in symmetric encryption.</p>

    <h3>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h3>
    <p>PKI manages digital certificates and public keys, enabling secure communications over insecure networks.
        Certificate authorities (CAs) verify identities and issue digital certificates. PKI underpins HTTPS, email
        encryption, and code signing.</p>

    <h2>Hash Functions</h2>
    <p>Cryptographic hash functions transform input data into fixed-size output values called hashes. Hash functions are
        one-way, meaning you cannot reverse the process to retrieve the original data. They ensure data integrity and
        authenticate messages.</p>

    <h3>Hash Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Password storage - Hash passwords instead of storing plaintext</li>
        <li>Digital signatures - Verify authenticity and integrity of messages</li>
        <li>Blockchain - Secure distributed ledger technology</li>
        <li>File integrity checking - Detect unauthorized modifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digital Signatures</h2>
    <p>Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to verify authenticity and integrity. The sender signs a message
        with their private key, and recipients verify the signature using the sender's public key. Digital signatures
        provide non-repudiation, proving that the sender actually sent the message.</p>

    <h2>Encryption Protocols</h2>

    <h3>TLS/SSL</h3>
    <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor SSL encrypt network communications. TLS protects web traffic
        (HTTPS), email, and other internet applications. Understanding TLS is essential for <a
            href="network_security.html">network security</a> and secure web development.</p>

    <h3>VPN Encryption</h3>
    <p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) use encryption to create secure tunnels over public networks. IPsec and OpenVPN
        are common VPN protocols that protect data in transit, enabling secure remote access to corporate networks.</p>

    <h2>Cryptanalysis and Attacks</h2>
    <p>Cryptanalysis attempts to break encryption systems and recover plaintext without the key. Common attacks include
        brute force, dictionary attacks, and side-channel attacks. Strong encryption algorithms and proper
        implementation resist cryptanalytic attacks.</p>

    <p>Attackers may also target implementation weaknesses rather than the algorithms themselves. Poor key management,
        weak random number generation, and timing vulnerabilities can compromise otherwise secure cryptographic systems.
        <a href="ethical_hacking.html">Security testing</a> helps identify such weaknesses.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Cryptography</h2>
    <p>Quantum computers pose a threat to current encryption algorithms, particularly RSA and ECC. Post-quantum
        cryptography develops algorithms resistant to quantum attacks. Organizations should prepare for the transition
        to quantum-resistant encryption.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use industry-standard algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA-256)</li>
        <li>Never implement custom cryptographic algorithms</li>
        <li>Generate strong random keys using cryptographically secure generators</li>
        <li>Protect private keys and implement secure key management</li>
        <li>Encrypt data at rest and in transit, especially in <a href="cloud_security.html">cloud environments</a></li>
        <li>Regularly update cryptographic libraries and protocols</li>
        <li>Prepare for post-quantum cryptography migration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Cryptography provides the mathematical foundation for modern information security. Understanding encryption,
        hashing, and digital signatures is essential for implementing secure systems. As technology evolves,
        cryptographic practices must adapt to maintain robust protection against emerging threats.</p>
