    <h1>Ethical Hacking</h1>

    <h2>What is Ethical Hacking?</h2>
    <p>Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, is the practice of intentionally probing
        computer systems, networks, and applications to find security vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could
        exploit. Ethical hackers use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers but with permission and for the
        purpose of improving security.</p>

    <h2>Key Principles of Ethical Hacking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authorization</strong> – Always obtain proper permission before testing</li>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> – Keep all findings confidential and share only with authorized parties
        </li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> – Do no harm to the systems being tested</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> – Report all vulnerabilities discovered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Ethical Hacking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Web Application Testing</strong> – Finding vulnerabilities in web applications</li>
        <li><strong>Network Penetration Testing</strong> – Testing network infrastructure security</li>
        <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong> – Testing human factors in security</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Network Testing</strong> – Assessing Wi-Fi and wireless security</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Security Testing</strong> – Evaluating physical access controls</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Application Testing</strong> – Finding security flaws in mobile apps</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Tools Used by Ethical Hackers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nmap – Network scanning and discovery</li>
        <li>Metasploit – Penetration testing framework</li>
        <li>Wireshark – Network protocol analyzer</li>
        <li>Burp Suite – Web application security testing</li>
        <li>John the Ripper – Password cracking tool</li>
        <li>Kali Linux – Penetration testing operating system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethical Hacking Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Reconnaissance</strong> – Gathering information about the target</li>
        <li><strong>Scanning</strong> – Identifying live hosts, ports, and services</li>
        <li><strong>Gaining Access</strong> – Exploiting vulnerabilities to access systems</li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining Access</strong> – Ensuring continued access for testing</li>
        <li><strong>Covering Tracks</strong> – Removing evidence of testing activities</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting</strong> – Documenting findings and recommendations</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Career in Ethical Hacking</h2>
    <p>Ethical hacking is a growing career field with increasing demand for skilled professionals. Common certifications
        include CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), and CompTIA PenTest+.
        Organizations across all industries need ethical hackers to protect their digital assets and ensure security
        compliance.</p>
